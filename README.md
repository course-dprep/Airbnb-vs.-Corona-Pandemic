# Airbnb vs. The Corona Pandemic: How's Airbnb doing? 

## Research motivation
It seems obvious that the Corona Pandemic, which finally seems to be coming to an end, has had the result of strongly reduced travel and overnight stays. Both locally and nationally. However, nothing could be further from the truth. There are certainly Airbnb hosts who have benefited from the Corona Pandemic. This research focusses mainly on the following research question: "*Which types of rooms in which neighborhoods benefited the most from the Corona Pandemic in London, United Kingdom?*" However, later on the content of this research can be used for other research on this topic for any other city. This research will be assessed based on three elements: (1) _**the number of listings**_, (2) _**the score of the reviews**_ and/or (3) _**price increases**_. To concretize the research, the different (1) _**room types**_ and (2) _**neighborhoods**_ are considered.  

The aforementioned research question is based on the available data from the Airbnb dataset. Initially, the research is done using multiple Airbnb datasets from London, United Kingdom. In total four different datasets are combined, each containing information per quarter. Due to limitations in the availability of datasets, as only the different datasets of 2021 are accessible without request and payment issues, it is not possible for this research to compare different years. However, the research will be delivered in such a way that any city - out of Airbnb's dataset - can be filled in to arrive at the requested data.  

This research benefits three stakeholders: (1) potential Airbnb hosts, (2) current Airbnb hosts looking to expand their offer and (3) Airbnb itself. The former can gain insight into their preferred city to what type of room they can most effectively offer and in which neighborhood. In so doing, they can best match the changes from the Corona Pandemic to the needs of the traveler. Airbnb can gain insight into supply and demand, adjust to it in whatever way it can, and also advertise more optimally on its website and via the app.  

Finally, the team decided to compare data of the beginning of 2021 with the end of 2021. Whereas for many countries the Corona Pandemic played a huge role in daily life at the beginning of 2021, this was much less the case at the end of 2021. For example, the relaxation of strict measures in the United Kingdom from July 18, 2021 (Gutiérrez, P., Duncan, P., Kirk, A., Robyn, M., McIntyre, N., Thomas, T., Blights, G., 2021). The figure below gives extra details on how the United Kingdom loosend their Corona measures in 2021 towards a normal situation like the situation before Corona ever happend.

## Research method
As mentioned above, this research will focus on the conbinations of room types and neighborhoods in London, United Kingdom. To be more precise 124 different room types-neighborhood combinations. The number of bookings, the score of the reviews and price increases will be used as explanatory variables in this research. Since the dependent variable in this research (124 room types-neighborhood combinations in London, United Kingdom) is a nominal variable, and the independent variables (number of listings, rating score, price) are metric variables, the method used in the research will be *Logistic Analysis*.
